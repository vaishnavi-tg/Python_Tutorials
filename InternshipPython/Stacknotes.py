'''A stack is a linear data structure in which the elements can be 
inserted and deleted from one side of the list called the top 

stack os LIFO
for inserting an element into the stack push operation is required 
for deletion from stack use pop operation 
The pointer in stack is called as top '''



'''Operations on stackslice   Time complexity(Capital O of 1 )
Push()              -------- o(1)(same for all)
Pop()               --------
Top() or Peek()     --------
isEmpty()           --------
size() or isFull()  -------


Inserting elements to stack (append())
Removing elements from stack (pop())
Top element in stack
Is stack empty or full'''
#Drawback of stack 
# It take more time complexity wen thier are many elements
